# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# puts "Creating flats!"

# Flat.create(address: "16 Villa Gaudelet, Paris", name: "Le Wagon HQ")
# Flat.create(address: "88, rue des etudiants,92400", name: "Adigio hotel")

# puts "2 flats created !"
